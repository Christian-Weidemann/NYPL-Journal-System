# NYPL-Journal-System
A hypothetical software system for the New York Public Library to import, store, browse and analyze scientific journals.

The system stores information on journals (and their publisher) containing multiple articles each with (potentially) multiple authors. Articles also contain information about their citations, enabling cross reference and calculation of the Hirsh-Index for each author; a metric to measure a researcherâ€™s impact. Data on journals and articles is imported from CSV text files.
